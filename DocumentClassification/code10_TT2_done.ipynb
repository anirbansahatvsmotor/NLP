Each vehicle has at least one sensor that detects the combustion state of fuel in the engine. The server stores a trained model related to engine control, which uses sensor data and gas station data (including location and fuel supply time period, but not fuel composition) to calculate a correction amount for the combustion state of the fuel. This correction amount is then transmitted to the target vehicle, which adjusts its fuel combustion accordingly. The trained model may also consider data related to the traveling position of the vehicles. The sensor data may include information about the engine's internal pressure, rotational speed, exhaust gas temperature, filter pressure difference, and nitrogen oxide concentration. The system also includes a vehicle capable of communicating with the server and adjusting its fuel combustion based on the received correction amount.

It involves the exchange of data between the vehicle and external devices through a traffic telematics system, including vehicle position, speed data, and local speed limits. A data processing device compares this data and detects the operating status of the adaptive cruise control, sending a signal containing the comparison results and the operating status to the vehicle or the driver's electronic handheld device. If the adaptive cruise control is not active and the driver tries to set a speed higher than the local speed limit, a signal is sent to prevent activation and/or warn the driver. If the cruise control is active and the set speed and current speed are higher than the local limit, a signal is sent to intervene in the ADAS and/or warn the driver through the vehicle's infotainment system. This intervention could be deactivating the cruise control or reducing the set speed to match the local limit. The data processing device can be related to the traffic telematics system, the vehicle, or an external device, and the collection of local speed limit data can be supported by an in-vehicle traffic sign recognition system.
